# EDMC_PluginBase

Bare as you like example code for creating .NET or native code plugins for Elite Dangerous Market Connector
https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector

Pythons a great language, but I'm very fond of managed code. C++ is also great, so creating the interface with C++/CLR gives a best of both worlds solution for the plugin authors choice of language.

Notes :
At the time of writing EDMC as distributed in installer form is 32 bit, so your plugins must be compiled specifically as 32bit. C# and 'any cpu' wont cut it.
